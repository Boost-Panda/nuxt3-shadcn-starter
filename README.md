# Nuxt3 shadcn Starter

I keep coming back to the [shadcn](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) design system for Vue.js. This is a starter template for Nuxt 3 that includes the shadcn design system. 

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview
```
